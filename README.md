# Medical Lien Analytics

## Overview
Medical Lien Analytics is a data-driven project aimed at determining the repayment ability of lien mortgage takers based on various financial and demographic features. The analysis involves data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization to derive insights and assess risk.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization techniques
- Statistical analysis for feature importance
- Potential machine learning model integration for prediction

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy seaborn matplotlib missingno
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Medical_Lien_Analytics.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and clean the dataset
   - Perform exploratory data analysis
   - Extract insights from statistical tests and visualizations

## Results
- Visual representations of case status distributions
- Analysis of key financial indicators
- Statistical insights into repayment probability
